# Herommunity

Based in a workshop for [Alura Online Course](https://www.alura.com.br/), it's a social network for heroes like you =)

Sorry I am lazy, so this is a rip off adaptation from the default `npx cleate-next-app --example with-styled-components alurakut` README.md so thank community :shrug:

But it is going to come back to haunt me later =P

## Preview

Preview the example live on [my github](http://wmiguita.github.io.com/alurakut)

## Deploy your own

The platform of choice was the github pages with the help of this incredible tutorial from [Joe](https://blog.sallai.me/deploy-next-site-to-github-pages)

Why pages if the workshop choice was Vercel do you ask me...

Well, as mentined before, I'm lazy and a little minimalistic, so I try to keep saving resources... and also accepted the self imposed challenge to use GH pages.

## How to use

First you can download the project with any preferred method =)

Using a terminal in the directory you created you can:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

To start the local server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### Backend setup

As mentioned before, the laziness would come catch me (curse you past  me), so GH pages does NOT have a functions(yet?) to make use of the nextjs BFF.

So authentication and leagues persistence are going to be with firebase

## Notes

- Thanks to Alura and Scuba the team for the wonderful support and material \o/
- This project will not be updated further than 19/07/2021, cause you know, I' lazy =P
- Está tudo em inglês meio zuado porque ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Code not within `src` because I came from gatsby file structure perspective :grimacing:
